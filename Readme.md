## Limitations

#### Main page
1. The project doesn't imply a page for searching for a hotel. So link `Find hotels` just leads to *Main page*.
#### Photos Page
2. The project doesn't imply playing videos. So playing videos is NOT implemented.
3. Displayed photos are supposed to be the links to their full-scale versions, however the project doesn't imply opening such links. So all displayed photos' links just lead to *Photos page*.
#### Review Form
4. The project doesn't imply API for the Review form. So processing POST-requests after submitting the form is NOT implemented.
